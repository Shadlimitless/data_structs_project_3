I am using binary search algorithm here, starting with two extreme ends 0 as base and the number. 
This algorithm has a complexity of o(log(n)) because every time I dont find the square root, I search from half of the remainder of values, either to the right or to left of last mid calculated value
Space complexity is o(1) since I am not creating new data structure
